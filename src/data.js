Powered by a 5.2 L V10 engine shared with the Gallardo, the engine generated a theoretical maximum power output of 600 PS (592 hp; 441 kW) and was accompanied with an all-wheel drive system. The Urus was reported to have the lowest carbon emissions as compared to its stablemates (i.e. the Porsche Cayenne, Bentley Bentayga and the Audi Q7). The Urus was conceived as a perfect daily driver unlike the other offerings from the brand. The sharp-lined exterior design of the SUV takes heavy influence from the company's V12 flagship, the Aventador. The production version of the SUV was introduced in 2017 with major changes done to the exterior and featuring a different powertrain than that of the concept.",

The Regera was developed and designed to be a more practical, luxurious, grand touring alternative to the rest of Koenigsegg's lightweight sports car lineup; initially the Agera and currently the Jesko. As a result, it is less focused on track performance and spartan weight reduction and more focused on the smooth and instant delivery of power provided by its overhauled powertrain. Koenigsegg states that the Regera will be one of the most powerful and fastest accelerating hybrid production cars produced.",

        "The Bentley Continental GT is a grand tourer manufactured and marketed by British automaker Bentley Motors since 2003. It was the first car released by Bentley under Volkswagen AG management, after the company's acquisition in 1998, and the first Bentley to employ mass production manufacturing techniques. In 1994, Rolls-Royce Motors (who at that time owned the Bentley brand) previewed a convertible concept car at the Geneva Motor Show – the Concept Java. The car was designed to be a highly desirable Bentley, but smaller, more affordable, yet still exclusive in order to maintain the integrity of the brand. It was to appeal to a new range of potential buyers and generate increase sales volume for Rolls Royce (at the time the current Bentley Continental R was an ultra-exclusive £180,000 in the UK, within reach of a very select market, selling only 2-300 units a year). The Concept Java never made it into production in the form seen in 1994 (although 13 cars were made for the Sultan of Brunei). However, the Bentley Continental GT realised the concept of the Java as a more affordable Bentley, manufactured in much larger volumes. Whilst external styling is different, the dashboard design was clearly influenced by the Java.",

The company was founded in 1909 by Wilhelm Maybach and his son, originally as a subsidiary of Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH, and it was known as Luftfahrzeug-Motorenbau GmbH until 1999 .In 1960, Maybach was acquired by Daimler-Benz. The name returned as a standalone ultra-luxury car brand in the late 20th century and early 21st century, sharing significant components with Mercedes-Benz cars. After slow sales, Maybach ceased to be a standalone brand by 2013, and it became (in 2015) a sub-brand of Mercedes-Benz, which is owned by Daimler AG. As of 2018, Daimler produces an ultra-luxury edition of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class under the Mercedes-Maybach name.",

It is Toyota's longest running series of models.[1] As of 2019, the sales of the Land Cruiser totalled more than 10 million units worldwide. Production of the first generation of the Land Cruiser began in 1951[2] as Toyota's version of a Jeep-like vehicle.[3][4] The Land Cruiser has been produced in convertible, hardtop, station wagon and cab chassis bodystyles. The Land Cruiser's reliability and longevity have led to huge popularity, especially in Australia, where it is the best-selling body-on-frame, four-wheel drive vehicle.[5] Toyota also extensively tests the Land Cruiser in the Australian outback – considered to be one of the toughest operating environments in both temperature and terrain.[6][7][8] In Japan, the Land Cruiser is exclusive to Toyota Japanese dealerships called Toyota Store.",

The initial model was available in a coupé body style, with a convertible body style added soon after. M3 sedans were available during the E36 (1994–1999) and E90 (2008–2012) generations. Since 2015 the M3 has been solely produced in the sedan body style, due to the coupé and convertible models being rebranded as the 4 Series range, making the high-performance variant the M4. Upgrades over the regular 3 Series models include engines, handling, brakes, aerodynamics, lightweight materials and various interior upgrades.",

        "The Chevrolet Corvette, colloquially known as the Vette, is a two-door, two-passenger sports car manufactured and marketed by Chevrolet across more than 60 years of production and eight design generations. From 1953 to 2019, it was front-engined, and since 2020, it is mid-engined. With its generations noted sequentially from C1 to C8, the Corvette serves as Chevrolet's halo vehicle and is widely noted for its performance and distinctive plastic—either fiberglass or composite—bodywork. In 1953, when GM executives were looking to name the new Chevrolet sports car, assistant director for the Public Relations department Myron Scott suggested Corvette after the small maneuverable warship—and the name was approved. The first model, a convertible, was introduced at the GM Motorama in 1953 as a concept and was followed ten years later by the 1963 second generation, in coupe and convertible styles. Originally manufactured in Flint, Michigan, as well as St. Louis, Missouri, the Corvette has been manufactured since 1981 in Bowling Green, Kentucky.",
